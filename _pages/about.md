**Welcome to my Homepage!** (Last Updated on 09/25/2025)

I'm a third year undergraduate student majoring in Statistics and minoring in Finance, at the **[Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en-us), [Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)**. During my undergraduate studies, I am supervised by Professor [Qi-Man Shao](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/shaoqiman.html) at SUSTech.

For my research experiences, I used to be a research intern in [Professor Hongyu Zhao's Lab](https://zhaocenter.org/) at Yale University in 2024. Also, I have been exploring a variety of other research areas under the supervision of [Prof. Rasmus Nielsen](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/rasmus-nielsen), [Dr. Molei Liu](https://moleibobliu.github.io/), and [Dr. Yifang Ma](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/mayifang.html), which span my research interests. My CV is 

My previous research experiences include:

(i) **Causal Inference and Machine Learning**: Kernel-assisted double/debiased machine learning under covariate shifts in modern complex datasets.

(ii) Statistical Genetics, especially genetic fine-mapping in GWAS studies.

(iii) Computational Social Science and Network Science, as applications.

I am very fortunate and grateful to be advised by my mentors and supervisors and to do research projects with my collaborators!
